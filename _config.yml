description: 👋 Hi, I’m Folagbade Abitogun
👀 I’m a writer. I write across different fields and industries. This repo is dedicated to my academic and research writing. Here, I will be uploading discussing some of my academic and research content, with the aim of carrying you along. with my writing process for each writing task I have from my clients.
🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity. Yes! This is one of the many fields I hope to start writing on very soon. So, I better continue learning, right? Also, Python got my attention and you can be sure I am going to pick it up.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing gigs and cybersecurity career information and activities. If you havw writng tasks that are being outsourced, I will be more than interested to discuss it with you
